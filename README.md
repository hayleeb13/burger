# burger

* This project uses a variety of tools including mysql and handlebars to create a burger eating application.
* The program displays burgers on the left side with a button that says "Devour!".
* When the user clicks on the button the burger moves to the right side and is shown as devoured. The data is also updated in mysql.
* The user also has the option to enter a burger, when this is done the burger pops up on the left side and shows as not devoured.
* The project is useful because it allows someone to interact with a webpage while also storing the data in an sql table.
* Simply get started by running "nodemon server" and clicking on the link.
* Any questions or issues regarding this program can be directed to Haylee Bell email hayleeb13@gmail.com.
